                            In a big city like New York, which houses too many nail salons to count, discovering the
                            really good
                            ones takes a lot of crowdsourcing, Yelp scrolling, and certainly some experimentation.
                            Walking out of
                            the salon and thinking about all of the ways your manicurist could have cut your cuticles
                            better or done
                            your design differently is a feeling we'd rather avoid.

                Trick-or-treaters, take your mark. Halloween is just days away! In
                celebration of the season, today we’re sharing an adults-only costume
                party that’s so spectacular, it’s spooky. To create an atmosphere that
                was more haute than haunted for this event, we turned a private
                residence into a VIP party zone. As soon as their feet hit the red
                carpet leading to the home’s entrance, guests were greeted by
                fire-breathing artists, flickering lanterns, and a custom spotlight
                announcing the party’s theme: Hallowdream: Day Dreams and Nightmares.

                Let me set the scene. It’s a Friday night, and I’m watching an episode
                of The Simple Life. Paris and Nicole are getting themselves into all
                sorts of trouble, and I’m wearing Juicy Couture track pants and
                online-shopping for a Dior saddlebag.
